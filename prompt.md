Imagine you are a consultant that is trying to solve a problem for qatar hamid airport,
you are required to track the flow of human traffic, and analyse the patterns, 
come up with recommendations backed by insights generated from the data of the tracking,
your solution is to use a wearable tag/tattoo/qr code/sticker equivalent on the sole of the shoe/body/wheel chair/crutch, 
you install it at both entry for departures and exit of arrivals for installation of tag,
you install something for the removal of the tags/tattoo/code/sticker at exit for arrivals and gate of the departures, 
imagine you are going to integrate with their existing systems of WIFI, XOVIS Sensors, Airport operational DB, and AI powered security camera, 
imagine this will be a cheap and easy to implement solution but is high impact and viable, 
now generate a multipage website setup for this with extensive immersive experience that is well thought out, good flow, 
make it an enterprise grade website to explain the concept, use css, multiple pages and other improvements
to ensure we have a good way to explain the solution, use the theming of the airport, 
have arabic theme to ensure it is well accepted by the people that want to accept the solution, 
also use theory of constraints based insighting to ensure proper installation,
and also use historical facts to ensure this project will be a raging success.

===========
use css, and use svg, use images thats freely available on the internet, ,
 and make it good , for the other aspects , also have the cost vs impact as a page seperately, 
 use css page, update the code to ensure we have proper coding standards
